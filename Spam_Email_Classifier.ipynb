    "## Spam classification ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/) of emails as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spam or a junk email might look like. Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam emails usually have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks or other special symbols like #,$. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam emails is a binary classification problem as emails are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised machine learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions. So for this classification task we will be focusing on Naive Bayes Algorithm.\n",

    "### Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less) and still performs extremely well for certain use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to understand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are a member of the Secret Service and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presidential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches. Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on the constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like the age, sex, and other smaller factors like is the person carrying a bag?, does the person look nervous? etc. you can make a judgement call as to if that person is viable threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. The Bayes theorem works in the same way as we are computing the probability of an event(a person being a threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events(age, sex, presence of bag or not, nervousness etc. of the person). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other. For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not as much as say if it was a grown man who was nervous. To break this down a bit further, here there are two features we are considering, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have a lot of false positives as there is a strong chance that minors present at the event will be nervous. Hence by considering the age of a person along with the 'nervousness' feature we would definitely get a more accurate result as to who are potential threats and who aren't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'Naive' bit of the theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can affect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(in our case, a message being  spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(in our case, the appearance of certain words in a message). We will dive into the workings of the Bayes theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with."

Remember that at the start of the mission we briefly discussed the Bayes theorem but now we shall go into a little more detail. In layman's terms, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of an event occurring, based on certain other probabilities that are related to the event in question. It is  composed of a  prior(the probabilities that we are aware of or that is given to us) and the posterior(the probabilities we are looking to compute using the priors). \n",

    "The term 'Naive' in Naive Bayes comes from the fact that the algorithm considers the features that it is using to make the predictions to be independent of each other, which may not always be the case. So in our Diabetes example, we are considering only one feature, that is the test result. Say we added another feature, 'exercise'. Let's say this feature has a binary value of `0` and `1`, where the former signifies that the individual exercises less than or equal to 2 days a week and the latter signifies that the individual exercises greater than or equal to 3 days a week. If we had to use both of these features, namely the test result and the value of the 'exercise' feature, to compute our final probabilities, Bayes' theorem would fail. Naive Bayes' is an extension of Bayes' theorem that assumes that all the features are independent of each other. "

    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages that Naive Bayes has over other classification algorithms is its ability to handle an extremely large number of features. In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them. The other major advantage it has is its relative simplicity. Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning it's parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. \n",
    "It rarely ever overfits the data. Another important advantage is that its model training and prediction times are very fast for the amount of data it can handle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular dataset it turned out Bernoulli Naive Bayes as the most accurate one with accuracy of approx. 90% compared to others NB with accuracy around 80% with k fold cross validation having an ideal value of k as 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it can be seen that Naive Bayes can be considered a good classifier when it comes to spam detection."
